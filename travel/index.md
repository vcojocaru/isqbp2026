### How to get to Cluj-Napoca

***

##### By plane

The easiest way to get to Cluj Napoca is by air. The Cluj [airport](https://www.airportcluj.ro/) is very conveniently located just a few kilometers from the city center. Public buses (regular and express) and taxis or Bolt/Uber cars serve the airport well and it takes at most about 30 minutes to ge to the center (maybe a little longer with the regular bus that stops at each bus station).

The Cluj airport is connected by the low cost airline [Wizzair](https://www.wizzair.com/) with many airports in Europe. Using a regular airline, a stop over in Muenchen, Bucharest, Warsaw or other European cities (depending on the constant addition of new routes). 

For flying from the U.S, Canada or other worldwide destinations the best option is flying with a stop over in Muenchen, Bucharest, Warsaw or other European cities (depending on the constant addition of new routes) is needed. It is worth checking very carefully the routes available. Please get in touch with us if in doubt.

VERY IMPORTANT: Flying into Budapest is only possible if booking a minibus drive or renting a car from the Budapest airport to Cluj-Napoca (see below)

##### By train

Unfortunately, it is rather complicated to get to Cluj-Napoca by train. And this is not because there is no railway but because the main route to the western border Cluj-Napoca - Oradea is being renewed and therefore no trains are running at the moment. 

From Budapest to Cluj-Napoca a train ride takes more than 10 hours (for only about 400 km).

From Bucharest, there is the option to take a night train. It takes a long time but the sleeping coaches (especially those with 2 or 4 beds per compartment) are usually in good conditions and one can sleep over. For possibilities, check the Romanian National Railway Company [CFR](https://www.cfrcalatori.ro/) or get in touch with us.

##### By road

It may be worth renting a car from Bucharest airport and drive to Cluj if you have an extra day and want to experience the beautiful sceneries of the Carpathians and other amazing attractions in Transylvania. There are many options to rent cars, similar to any other country in the European Union and conditions are usually similar.

From Budapest and Bucharest airports there are also dedicated minibuses that can be booked in advance and the drivers will usually wait for you at the airport. The price is usually good unless you want to driver for you alone. If you decide to try such a route (e.g. for example if you have a really good flight offer to Budapest) please get in touch with us to check the minibus companies available.

In addition to renting a car or a minibus drive, there are also new large buses (e.g. Flixbus) which offer connections to Cluj-Napoca. These are rather new and subject to changes, so its good to keep a close eye on any new options. Of course the main disadvantage comparing to cars or minibuses is that the drive with a large bus takes significanlty longer.

### Accommodation possibilities

There are many hotels in Cluj, from simple to luxury ones. We will compile a list of hotels within a close range to the conference venue and will post it here.

In addition to hotels, on platforms such as booking.com or airbnd.com, you can also book apartments which are usually a cheap (depending on the comfort you wish for of course) and cosy alternative to hotels but do not offer breakfast (except coffee and tee which are usually available in all) or other services. Note that there are many options to have breakfast at nearby locations experiencing the city (and June is usually a month with fantastic weather)

Since it is a busy student city quite attractive for young peolple, Cluj also has a number of hostels that can be interesting for students with lower budgets.
